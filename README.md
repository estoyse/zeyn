# shaxsiy-oyin

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, Hono, TRPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
- **workers** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **SQLite/Turso** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses SQLite with Drizzle ORM.

1. Start the local SQLite database (optional):
   D1 local development and migrations are handled automatically by Alchemy during dev and deploy.

2. Update your `.env` file in the `apps/server` directory with the appropriate connection details if needed.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
pnpm run db:push
```

4. Seed the game content. A fresh database is empty — the buzzer game needs at
   least 5 subjects and the music quiz needs artists, so seed before playing.
   `db:seed` loads the trivia subjects/questions and fetches real 30s song
   previews from the iTunes Search API (needs outbound network). It targets the
   **local** D1 file and is idempotent:

```bash
pnpm run db:seed
```

### Seeding a remote / production D1

`db:seed` only writes to the local D1 file. Deploys apply **migrations** to the
remote D1 (via Alchemy) but not content, so a fresh prod database has the tables
but no games' content. To load content into a remote D1, generate a SQL file and
apply it with Wrangler:

```bash
# 1. Generate packages/db/seed.sql (fetches music previews from iTunes)
pnpm run db:seed:sql

# 2. Find your D1 database name/id
pnpm --filter server exec wrangler d1 list

# 3. Apply it to the remote D1 (idempotent: ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING)
pnpm --filter server exec wrangler d1 execute <DB_NAME> --remote --file=../../packages/db/seed.sql
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to see the web application.
Use the Expo Go app to run the mobile application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@shaxsiy-oyin/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Deployment (Cloudflare via Alchemy)

- Dev: pnpm run dev
- Deploy: pnpm run deploy
- Destroy: pnpm run destroy
